# Template repository for spring boot applications

The goal of this template is to get teams quickly started with a production ready spring setup
including CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure.

## Getting started

Simply run the setup script via `./setup.sh` it will ask for team name, service name and slack channel
and make sure we rename all placeholders.

For more details on working with this see [README.service.md](./README.service.md)
